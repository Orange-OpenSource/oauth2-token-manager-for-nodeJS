# Manage Oauth token in NodeJs
This project aims to show how to manage Oauth token lifecycle. You could freely reuse the token module in your project. It use [Got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) to handle http requests process.

## Content
Based on [openid-client](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) to use it in your project, you need to add a dependency to `openid-client`, and then download the files [token.js](common/token.js) and [retry.js](common/retry.js) from this project, and add it in yours, feel free to adapt it if needed.

## First time run
1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/oauth2-token-manager-for-nodeJS.git

2. Install project dependencies

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. Subscribe to [an API](https://developer.orange.com/products/) for this sample choose [An SMS API](https://developer.orange.com/?s=sms&c=&type=api)

4. Get your client id and secret provided to you

5. Set your client id, secret, API hostname, token endpoint within `.env`

6. Run the script

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
7. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, and voil√†.

To check if token calls work, you could try to sent you an SMS phone_number format without country number, neither the 0: http://localhost:3000/sms?phone_number=623456789&message=mylocalappwork

`token.js` module use environnement variables (loaded via `dotenv` in that sample project): 
* CLIENT_ID
* CLIENT_SECRET
* DISCOVER_URL (optionnal) e.g `DISCOVER_URL = "https://GATEWAY/oauth/v3/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server"`
* TOKEN_ENDPOINT (optionnal if DISCOVER_URL is provided)
* API_HOSTNAME Hostname to join the API without protocol e.g `GATEWAY`
* SCOPES (optionnal) Each requested scopes needed separated by a space

When it's done, you could use the module in any file of your project by importing the token and retry module, and call `getAccessToken` function. This function return a promise, as an example of how to use it you could take a look at [sms.js](./routes/sms.js).

`Retry` module allow to manage token expiration and then intercept the error to allow refreshing token and retrying the request
